          <h3>Raiders of the Lost Ark</h3>
          <p>Lucas conceived Raiders of the Lost Ark
            in the early 1970s. Seeking to modernize
            the serial films of the early 20th-century,
            he developed the idea further with
            Kaufman, who suggested the Ark as the
            film's goal. Lucas eventually focused on
            developing his 1977 space opera Star
            Wars.</p>

          <h3>Temple of Doom</h3>
          <p>The film was released to financial
          success but initial reviews were mixed,
          criticizing its darker elements and
          violence. However, critical opinion has
          improved since 1984, citing the film's
          intensity and imagination.</p>

          <h3>The last crusade</h3>
          <p>After the mixed reaction to Indiana Jones
          and the Temple of Doom, Spielberg chose
          to tone down the dark tone and graphic
          violence in the next installment. During
          the five years between The Temple of
          Doom and The Last Crusade, he and
          executive producer Lucas reviewed
          several scripts before accepting Jeffrey
          Boam's.</p>
